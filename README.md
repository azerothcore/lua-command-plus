# Command+

### Description

	I share my Command+.
	Command+ it's a script for create news command for AC.

	You can configure the commands by changing the code directly.

	This script adding a few commands :
	- player teleport #game_tele           === Teleport selected player to game_tele
	- getmodel item | npc | gob #entry     === Return Model of #entry
	- getnpc entry | guid | model          === Return Information of Selected NPC
	- duplicate item | npc | gob #entry    === Duplicate *_template #entry on DB
	
	In developpment : 
	- player set faction #race             === Set player faction for race enter


	I still recommend changing the code only if you are sure of what you are doing.

	I will not support any changes to the commands in the code.
